            <h2>Learning is sweet</h2>
            <p>As a first grade Reading Recovery teacher, I had to do assessments at the beginning of the school year to
                determine which students qualified for the program. Part of the assessment was having them read a sheet
                with randomly ordered upper and lowercase letters. One of the students I was testing came to a lowercase
                <span class="text-blue w-bold">“m”</span>. He looked and looked at it. Finally, he turned to me and
                said, “I have seen that letter on M&M’s,
                but I don’t know what it’s called.” —Submitted by Heidi Bailey, Tremonton, Utah.

            <h2>Fueling the fire</h2>
            <p>My three-year-old daughter was trying to roast a marshmallow for the first time. Her first and second
                attempts ended in <span class="text-blue w-bold">flames</span>. Both times, I took the scorched
                marshmallow off of the roasting stick and
                threw it into the fire. The third time, I helped her a lot more and, together, we achieved a perfectly
                toasty golden brown. Once it was cool, I handed her the marshmallow which she promptly threw into the
                fire. No one had told her she was supposed to eat it. —Submitted by Lou Roess, Parachute, Colorado. </p>

            <h2> Long and the short</h2>
            <p>I am an 84-year-old gentleman who stands 5’4” tall from the basketball-crazy state of Indiana. Recently,
                my wife and I were having dinner at a local restaurant. Our waiter was a young man, around 6’8”.
                Naturally, I asked him if he played <span class="text-blue w-bold">basketball</span>. He looked down at
                me, replied, “Yes, I do,” and then
                asked me if I played miniature golf. —Submitted by Paul Kinghorn, Rising Sun, Indiana</p>

            <h2>The wild bunch</h2>
            <p>While at a motel in North Dakota, I went to breakfast and sat by a gentleman who was on the phone. I
                overheard him say that he had “lost time yesterday” because his “passengers got cranky” so he “stopped
                at a truck stop and hosed them down with cold <span class="text-blue w-bold">water</span>.” Then I
                noticed a school bus in front of the motel
                that hadn’t been there the day before. When the gentleman ended his call, I asked him if that was his
                bus. “No,” he replied. “I’m in the back with a semi load of pigs.” —Submitted by David Flemming,
